# BRANDEE

BRANDEE is an excavation rover built for the NASA Lunabotics competition. It was the first rover I helped work on, contributing both on the electrical and software subteams. It was the first rover the team delivered which ran out of the last 5 years. However, her design was heavy and slow, which did not bode well for the competition.

Ultimately, while not optimized, the electrical and software systems worked well, and the rover was able to perform basic functions such as driving, arm movement, and excavation. It taught me a lot of great design lessons, such as the importance of modularity, organization, and the value of correct electrical connectors (Ease of use, and vibration resistance).
