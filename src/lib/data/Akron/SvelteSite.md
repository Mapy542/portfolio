# The first svelte site

I rewrote the University of Akron's robotics team website in SvelteKit in partnership with another teammate. The previous site was dated, not mobile friendly, and difficult to update. We wanted to explore a modern framework and get the benefits of using a non-static site. We now have dynamic content such as an events calendar which is synchronized from our discord server, a contact form, and an attendance tracker for meetings. The site is also much easier to update and maintain.

As of now I am the sole maintainer, with the attendance tracker being the latest feature. It "clocks in" members by swiping their university ID cards, and tracks attendance over time. This is a huge improvement over the manual Excel sheet which managers had to manually update (often just not doing so).
