# Tipping Point Robot, Worlds Attendee

For the VEX Robotics Competition season of 2021-2022, our team designed and built a robot to compete in the game Tipping Point. The game involved picking up and placing toroids onto base structures, as well as balancing on a seesaw-like structure. Our robot was designed to pick up and manipulate the bases with a custom cascade/telescopic lift.

Our robot also featured an x-drive chassis, which is a holonomic drive system that allows for movement in any direction. This allowed us to combine a trailing wheel odometry system into a fully functional autonomous program. We defined a routine of waypoints relative to the starting position, and the robot would navigate to each point following a direct path.

Because of this, our robot was really competitive especially in the Skills competition section. We won the excellence award at states; earning the bid to the World Championship. At Worlds, we did not place as high as we had hoped, but the experience of competing at such a high level and meeting teams from all over the world was unforgettable.
