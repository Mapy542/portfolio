# Launch Vehicle

The launch vehicle is a mechanically timed ping pong ball launcher vehicle with hanging mass energy storage. It was designed in Autodesk Inventor and manufactured with a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting.
It was a project for pre-engineering class in high school. The goal was to drive 5 feet, and only then launch a ping pong ball to hit a target another 5 feet away. The vehicle had to be powered by a mechanical energy storage, and the launch had to be mechanically timed.
