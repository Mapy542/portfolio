# PA Governor's STEM Challenge

My team and I designed and built a facial recognition entry system for our high school as our entry to the 2023 PA Governor's STEM Challenge. The system uses a Google Coral dev board to run a TensorFlow Lite model for on-device facial recognition. It controls an electronic push bar lock on the school's main entrance door, allowing students to enter by simply looking at the camera.

The problem this was addressing was access to facilities outside of school hours. Athletic teams and clubs often need to access the building for practices and meetings, but the front office is not staffed after hours.

We designed a model door and push bar exit system to demonstrate the concept.
