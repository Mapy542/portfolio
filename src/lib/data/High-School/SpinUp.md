# Spin Up, Worlds Qualifier

Following the Tipping Point season, our team continued to compete in VEX Robotics with the Spin Up game for the 2022-2023 season. This game involved picking up and shooting discs into goals, as well as rapidly expanding during end-game for points. Our robot was designed with a custom intake system to efficiently collect discs from the field and a flywheel shooter to launch them accurately into the goals. We implemented a pneumatic triggered expansion mechanism which launched weighted strings across the field.

This robot, being quite a bit heavier than our previous design, struggled to maneuver on a new version of the X-Drive chassis. The autonomy program was often more accurate than our drivers, but it was still a challenge to score consistently. We ended up winning the Design Award at states, which qualified us for the World Championship. Due to performance concerns and time constraints, we did not bring this robot to Worlds, but the experience of designing and building it was invaluable.
